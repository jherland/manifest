- More efficient stat()ing in ManifestDirWalker
- Similar refactoring in ManifestTarWalker
- Consider splitting merge() and diff() out of Manifest class
- Provide an __init__.py to make us more like a proper Python package?
- Add walk() functionality to drill into .tar files as if they were a
  regular dir.
- Add support for git trees?
- Add support for wildcard entries? (This manifest will match zero or more
  entries at this level. Format: glob or regexp?)
- Add more support for per-entry attributes, like approximate size, permission
  check, modification timestamp checks?
- Add frontend for generating more human-friendly reports
